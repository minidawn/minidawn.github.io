title: "Why Did I Create Markdawn?"

There are lots of content platforms out there. Some of them are quite good, but all are focused on one type of content: short publishing or a medium format. I want Markdawn to be the first platform that takes long format into consideration.

### So, why?

The easy answer: because I want to read great content while I'm on the go. The reality is a bit different, so I'll explain. I travel for 2 hours each day and I wish there was a way to get great content on my iPhone instead of going to Hacker News or Reddit and getting external links to various sites.

If that didn't answer the question: because I have a big idea and concept about how content should be written and read digitally. Think this is the first iPod in an era of MP3 players, the idea has been done before, but not like this. The concept started in 2007, when I released a WordPress theme called “The Journalist” to ease the pain of transition from paper to screen. It was a success, people like [Steven Sinofsky](http://blog.learningbyshipping.com/) and [John Moltz](http://verynicewebsite.net/) are still using it.

### To mark or not to mark

My journal just became "useless" with the last article written there: [the Dawn of a New Era](http://lucianmarin.com/archive/dawn-of-new-era.html). The writing experience on Markdawn is so much better. If you're using a modern browser, you can zoom in at 150% or 200% to adjust not only the font size, but also the neat interface.

Promoting it will be quite a challenge for me. I settled on a typeface, a photographic concept and I hope it works out in the end. It can be seen on [Instagram](http://instagram.com/p/d1Yhh2Pq5Y/) and [Friskr](http://friskr.com/post/60088348601).
