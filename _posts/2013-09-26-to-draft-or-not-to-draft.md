title: "To Draft or Not To Draft"

Implementing drafts on Markdawn isn't a complicated thing. I've already done it on a test environment. The problem I see is a psychological thing. If you plan to write multiple articles you eventually get out of focus. I want everyone to focus on a single piece of art.

Markdawn is using Local Storage feature introduced with HTML 5. It basically autosaves your draft on your computer, not on our servers. This makes privacy a non-issue and it should stay this way in the future. "Saved locally" will appear right after you start typing and it means the draft is saved and will remain saved until you click "Publish" or delete the content manually. Content remains saved even if you refresh the page, go to another page or site or even if you log out.

### Regarding draft previews

Most services let you see a preview of you article before you publish it. But with Markdown syntax I don't see this an issue. If you understand the principles of using [Markdown syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#philosophy) in the first place, you'll understand that previewing an article is the same as writing it.

I'm open to feature requests and other suggestions. On the top of the list are *categories*, *favorite articles* and a way to follow interesting articles or writers.
