Free spirits can't express themselves in 140 characters and shouldn't. It's against their nature, their way of being. Killing creativity in people is the worst thing corporations are trying to do today. Everything is limited, everything is freedom banned. You get a 612 pixels squared images out of Instagram, nothing more than that. You put in so much creativity effort, buy expensive gears and gadgets. You end up with endless nothings.

Words are always high quality, they will never lose their touch. Words can touch people in so many ways that a picture can't. Words are powerful, words are love, words are freedom.

### Freedom can be tricky

Too much freedom can potentially seen in a damaging way. Imagine if we had the freedom to travel to the entire Universe. How would Earth look like if we were born with this power? Not as good as when we would gain the freedom to this on our own. Freedom is achievable in a sense of earning it.

How can you manage freedom? This is my mind since I'm building this project. The term “freedom management” is hunting me. Why would you want to manage freedom? I'll want to manage freedom for better outcomes. Every detail of this site is particularly thought to have a good outcome. You put in beautiful words, you should get a great article at the end. You leave a remark on someone's article, it'll be seen on your profile too. Universe with its laws is the best definition of freedom management:

$$  i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\psi = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 \psi + V \psi  $$

$$ E = mc^2 $$

### Management is not engineering

What engineering can do is to design ways to facilitate continuous harmony between entities. There should not be a preconception about what to do. Once the harmony exists and the concept is correct you can do whatever you want.

I always wanted to do a system of the future. The first time I learnt about HTML, I knew that it could the future. Yet, HTML was a language for the machines, not for human communication. Markdown syntax is a way to humanize HTML and it's evolving rapidly to the point that the conversion between human language and machine language is straight forward and correct. Markdawn is a system powered by current and future versions of Markdown syntax.
