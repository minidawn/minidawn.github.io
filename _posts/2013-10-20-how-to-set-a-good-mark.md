title: "How to Set a Good Mark?"
author: lucian

I want every single person on this planet to write articles. So they can set their own marks. If you set your own mark, you become free, you don't depend on someone else. Yes, you share the same ideas and principles with other people, but you have your own identity and judgment.

The simple way to do it is to write your idea down, then explain it. I started this article by writing down three very small ideas:

* how to write a good article
* some technical and practical ways to do it
* how to overcome fear of writing

[Markdown syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is very helpful for guiding your writing. You can make lists, you split things in blocks of content, you use tabs or spaces to align different types of content, you put emphasis on some words and the text editor on Markdawn helps you create links as fast as you write. And by the time you finish, you got something worth sharing with the world.

People are afraid of writing. They think only about the subject, their mind start to look for millions of related information and their body doesn't follow. All of this is natural, that's why we write in sentences, we split content in paragraphs, we use subtitles. You don't have to be a writer to write, since you don't have to be a race driver to drive.

Twitter and Facebook are worthless because we don't explain our ideas. We compose a tweet about a random fact, the fact gets read by other people and we move on. We waste some much energy on nothings. Now imagine if we explained those ideas on a large scale, patterns will start to emerge, thoughts will start to blossom and suddenly the world changes.
