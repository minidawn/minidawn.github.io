When you start build something you always wanted to build, hesitation make its appearance. But going back to using all kinds of social networks, having a blog that needs attention and lots of apps that scream for my input is not what future should be like.

### Back to Markdawn

I think I have to slow down and build something that will last as long as possible. I already optimized everything for speed, size and accessibility. The next thing is to figure ways to keep the cost down and sustain the further development of this web application. I was thinking that a nice way to cut spam and bring a little profit is to ask each new member for $1. Yes, that's right $1 for each account. I have yet to find a way to do that elegantly, without being a burden to get in. The other way is to introduce ReCaptcha or something like that.

### Back to the future

Back in the day, before all social networks that ask you for an one line input, all people that had something to say on the web were using blogs. But simple blogging software become complete CMS alternatives, so hard to use that even doing a basic template for your articles is almost impossible. Markdawn takes the easy input of modern social networks and ask you for a title of your post. Basically, asking people for a title is like converting crap into gold. Yes, that's right. A title makes your post a little piece of art, a small Instagram, *a lettergram* or *a markgram*. So if you want to apply some filters to your words, you have Markdown syntax to help you do that easily. You can even do a book with Markdawn, export the articles, convert them to ePUB or have them printed.

In the last two weeks, I stopped writing and doing almost nothing on web. I think I tweeted once for no other reason that I felt an urge to do it. I wanted to know if I feel the desire to come back and write here on Markdawn. And I did, slowlyâ€¦ but steady. What is that feel that makes you want to come here and write, how can you design *that feeling*, how can you make it work. These are the things I want to focus on, small details that will make hesitation disappear, not only for me but for everyone that want a nice place to express themselves.

This is in no way related to latest [Nine Inch Nails album](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hesitation_Marks). Keeping that in mind, I think [Find My Way](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSZKUgxwy54) is a pretty good song.
