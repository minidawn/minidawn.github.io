The idea of this *mark* came from [Irina](http://markdawn.com/irina/). She told me that she would listen to “Jubel” on repeat after finding it on radio. Probably that jazz beat had something to do with it. Then I remembered that I used to collect songs that I would listen “[On Repeat](https://soundcloud.com/lucianmarin/sets/on-repeat)” on SoundCloud.

* [Jubel](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6vSf0cA9qY) (*Klingande*)
* [Lost It To Trying](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkLT5krv_6c) (*Son Lux*)
* [Tessellate](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg6BwvDcANg) (*alt-J*)
* [Us](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpIz5sAu0B8) (*Movement*)
* [Kathy Lee](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZF2lZesYZo0) (*Jessy Lanza*)
* [Like a Dream](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqhaMewA2K0) (*Francis and the Lights*)
* [Elliot](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yl5WfT7IDDU) (*Roosevelt*)
* [Recollection](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lC8pMIzXvuw) (*Keep Shelly in Athens*)

I made this list of songs and music videos because I think they are perfect for this month. If you have a song that hunts you for days, please share it in the remarks section.

I almost forgot how easy is to write on Markdawn.
