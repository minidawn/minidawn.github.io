title: "Making the case for a 5-inch iPhone"

If Apple will introduce a bigger iPhone, it will definitely have a 5-inch screen. If they'll keep the same PPI, then it will have a resolution of 1440x810 pixels. That means it will give user a usable 720x405 screen area.

### How did I end up with these numbers?

I think a new vertical row of icons will be the most wanted feature for a bigger iPhone. That means the width of the phone will be 1.25 times higher that the current screen width of the iPhone which is 5 cm. The screen width will be 6.25 cm which matches the average size of the male thumb. The screen height will be 11.11 cm based on 16:9 aspect ratio of the screen. Based on these numbers, the diagonal of the new phone will be exactly 12.75 cm (5 inches). If we apply the same math to the resolution will end up with a 1440x810 screen.

### A new generation of apps

The 720x405 (1440x810) resolution gets in the computer screen territory. This means the new generation of apps will be more powerful, they'll have more features and they will feel more like tablet apps. The new bigger iPhone will be the computer in your pocket, everywhere and anywhere. I think that cases with integrated keyboards will actually be a thing.

The geek in me can't hardly wait to see and play with the rumored iPhone 6.
