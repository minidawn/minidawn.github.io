title: "Improving Readability"

One of the core features of Markdawn is *reading ability*. I wanted to improved it as much as I can in the latest update.

Most designers try to improve readability by using very dark shades of grey (e.g. *#444*) on white backgrounds. While this might reduce the contrast, it still causes eye fatigue after a few minutes of staring at the screen.

The LCD screen is like a translucent piece of paper lighten by a lantern. “Whites” means that the piece of paper is 100% transparent, while “blacks” try to make the piece of paper as opaque as possible. This is the reason why the background of Markdawn is actually a very bright shade of gray.

I know this is a very radical change in a very short time, but I strongly believe people will love it after adapting to it. I will continue my march of setting new standards of design while improving the usability of the web app on mobile devices as time goes by.
