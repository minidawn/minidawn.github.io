Since HN is down I'm going to watch [Australian Open](http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/tennis/livematch/671838.html) and checking MD for updates.

I hope Wawrinka will win the tournament, since [Simona Halep](http://www.wtatennis.com/players/player/13516/title/simona-halep) couldn't make it to the finals. These two being my favorites.

I'm glad I'm seeing snow outside for the second time this winter. I hope it will last a little longer. I'm blaming Russians for keeping the snow just for them.

Later update: Stan Wawrinka is in the final.
