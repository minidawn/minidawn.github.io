I'm open to any suggestion about how you want this awesome idea to continue.

I think this is the right thing to do since the usage is below acceptable and I don't have any possibilities for marketing. Some stats since launch from Google Analytics:

* 10,000 visits
* 7,250 unique visitors
* 70,000 pageviews
* 4m 30s avg. visit duration
* 140 registered users

The option for exporting the content was available from day one. The export files are Markdown files fully compatible with any another apps. This allows to backup your content easily.

I'm open for partnerships, funding or any others ideas (even some crazy ones). You should contact me over mail: lucian at [lucianmarin.com](http://lucianmarin.com/).
