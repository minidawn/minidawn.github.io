I suppose there's a moment when you want things to be different. In a modern, futuristic world people want change. Some might say that you deserve the best, some might claim a few human rights.

Markdawn became the impossible perfection . If I look at the code behind it, everything is so complex and complete. It's like I didn't even code it few months ago.

Now I started working on [Sublevel](http://sublevel.net/) a new web application powered by Django. Every line of the code that goes in the new web application makes me come back to Markdawn to add a few new features here and there. It makes me wonder what's missing or is it just a marketing issue that I can't get pass through.

### What's next?

The next big thing in blogging is making both the content and the system completely free and open. Jekyll is now ubiquitous. Git is now universal. Markdown syntax is used everywhere. The last thing that needs to be freed is the content.

Lots of people need an online place to write, a public place where they can share their limitless thoughts. Markdawn can be that place.

The new Markdawn wants to be the Wikipedia of publishing.
